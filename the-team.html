        <h4>The team &amp; our vision</h4>
				<p>“My father had a business that designed and printed case report forms and I always wondered why his clients still printed forms rather than using a computer application. The more I explored the reasoning the more I understood why and the idea formed to do something about it. Typical software solutions are both complex and expensive, making them impractical for smaller trials and requiring significant commitments in terms of time, training and infrastructure.</p>
        <br />
        <p>I formed a team to create a solution that would remove those barriers. A system that would make those difficult choices clients have to make in terms of investment of time and money completely redundant. A system you can set up yourself that frees you from paperwork and lengthy and complex data entry, so you can concentrate on what really matters... the trial itself. In CRFweb, I believe we have succeeded in creating a complete solution that’s accessible to all, and that gives trial managers greater control of their trials.”</p>

        <p>Prior to founding Clindox, Mats was the Global Sales Director for a financial software company based in London. Concurrently, he acted in an advisory role with DMP; a CRF design and printing company based in Sweden.</p>
        <p>Mats has an unblemished track record of founding and building up businesses in the Nordics, the UK and US. He founded Financial Distribution Services (FDS) an anglo-scandinavian financial courier and printing service. As Global Head of Sales he helped build the business to a £5M turnover in only 5 years before selling the business to the Royal Mail. He subsequently took over printing business Citiprint which after several years of consecutive growth he sold to financial print specialist Chris Fowler International. As part of that deal Mats agreed to become President of Chris Fowler’s US business, whose decline he turned around before they too were sold on.</p>
